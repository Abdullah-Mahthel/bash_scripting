These are some notes about bash script:

-Hello World > hello.txt // this will write Hello world to the hello.txt file BUT 
    when you write the same command with different message this will over write the presvious message


-Hello World >> hello.txt // this will write the same message and when you run the same command 
this will APPEND the following message

						
-wc -w < hello.txt // this command count how many words in the file 

-cat << EFO // this command allow you to write until you write EOF "End of file"

-wc -w <<< "Hello there wordcount"  // this command count the string in double quotes
-Look at the following bash script :
#!/usr/bin/bash

if   [ ${1,,} = abady ]; then
         echo "oh you are the boss , Welcome"
elif [ ${1,,} = help ]; then
         echo " just enter ur name .."

else 
         echo " l dont know who r u but your not the boss"

fi         

l try to write my first name with capital 'A' but it refuese to show the proper result
l dont know why :/

this example talk about if and else statements 
-To excute the above code => ./nameofthefile.sh abady => the output should be "u r the boss"
 ./nameofthefile.sh help => "just enter ur name " ..etc
Hello there
hi
